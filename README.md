# DAND: Investigate A Dataset

In this project, I pick a dataset and through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib were used to make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier.

# Dataset
The No Show Appointments Dataset has over than 100 thousand records for booking medical appointments. These appointments are for clinics in Brazil. The dataset records whether a patient has showed up for an appointment or not along side other characteristics such as gender, age and appointment day.

# Questions that are planned to be explored over the course of this report:

- Is gender associated with no show appointments?
- Does age has a correlation with no show appointments?
- Which age group is associated with no show appointments?
- Are no show appointments associated with a certain day of the week?
